Looking for a way to bridge the gap between Event Storming and prototyping or even production-ready solutions?

[Cody]({{site.baseUrl}}/cody/introduction.html) sounds nice, but developing your own code generator on top of it is too much hassle?

We've got you covered!

## Built on the shoulders of giants

Cody Engine is a **ready-to-use** Open Source solution to transform an [Event Map]({{site.baseUrl}}/continuous_event_storming/event-map-design.html)
into a prototype and if you want also into a production-ready system.

To make this possible, we decided to go all-in with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). TypeScript gives use a single platform to develop
a web-based **Client-Server-Application**, well suited for an information management system.

## Open Source

You can find the Cody Engine project on [GitHub](https://github.com/proophboard/cody-engine). 

Questions, feedback, ideas and contributions are all welcome! You can use the [Cody Engine Issue Tracker](https://github.com/proophboard/cody-engine/issues){: .alert-link} to get in touch.
