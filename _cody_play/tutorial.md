Let's bring [Event Modeling]({{site.baseUrl}}/event_modeling/why-event-modeling) to life with the help of Cody Play.

You'll learn the basics of working with the prototyping tool Cody Play.

We will develop an Open Space Planning app. 

- Organizers can plan an open space
- attendees can register, suggest topics and vote for them

Here is a walk-through video of the final app. It goes beyond the typical "todo list app" example.
We have two different roles with different permissions. A flexible voting limit and more.

    </video>
</div>


After the tutorial you will be able to turn your own
Event Modeling into a real world prototype.

You can also play with the final app yourself, before starting the tutorial.

## Start Cody Play

*For the tutorial we start with a fresh board and focus on one concept at a time.*

As a first step, we need a new prooph board as our work surface, and also a clean Cody Play application. You can do the entire tutorial
in the [free version of prooph board](https://free.prooph-board.com) (no registration required), that ships with full Cody Play support.

1. Open [prooph board](https://free.prooph-board.com)
2. Add a new board and name it: **Open Space Tutorial**
3. Start a new Cody Play session (Top Menu -> Cody Play -> Start a new Session)

Cody Play is a read-to-use prototyping application. It runs completely in your browser. You don't need to install anything, and all data is only stored in your browser's local storage.
You can save [Playshots]({{site.baseUrl}}/cod_play/playshots) to back up your work and share it with anybody who has access to the connected prooph board (only possible in the paid version of prooph board).
