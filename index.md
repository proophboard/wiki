:wave: **Welcome to the prooph board wiki!**

Cross-functional teams, collaboration and experiments are key drivers to innovate and keep software and business aligned.

**Development teams are asked to be multidisciplinary.** 

How can they tackle domain and tech complexity in an efficient and sustainable way? 

How can they set goals, plan work, run experiments and serve user needs in the best possible way and all this within a lean workflow?


[prooph board](https://prooph-board.com/){: .alert-link} is the tool to support it all.

**What's your role?**

We've put together a getting started guide for each possible role of a cross-functional team, because every role has a slightly different focus and will enjoy different features:
