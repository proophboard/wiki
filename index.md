:wave: **Welcome to the prooph board wiki!**

Cross-functional teams, collaboration and experiments are key drivers to innovate and keep software and business aligned. We see Event Storming and Collaborative Modeling as one of the best ways to achieve this goal.

With prooph board you can digitize your storming. Model together in a (remote) team, document the system and generate code from event models.

The wiki is structured into three main parts: **Event Storming** on prooph board, **Collaborative Modeling** for system engineering and working with **Cody** - the Coding Bot.
