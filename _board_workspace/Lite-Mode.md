If you encounter performance problems on large boards or during video calls, you can turn on the Lite Mode. This will disable zoom effects like hiding elements or scaling the font size of Bounded Context and Feature frames.

Effects turned off means your browser has less expensive tasks to do. This saves CPU and therefore also battery time.

Disadvantage of course is, that you no longer get the high level overview. Use the navigation tree and search in the left sidebar to still find the information you're looking for.
{: .alert .alert-warning}

Switching between Normal and Lite Mode can be done in the workspace top menu. It's the battery icon next to your avatar. The following table compares both modes:

|   |  Mode  | High Level Overview | Font Scaling | Performance |
|---|:------:|:-------------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/normal_mode.png" />  | Normal |          ✅          |       ✅      |      ❌      |
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/lite_mode.png" />  |  Lite  |          ❌          |       ❌      |      ✅      |

_The chosen mode is persisted across sessions. If you prefer to always work in Lite Mode, you can set it once._
