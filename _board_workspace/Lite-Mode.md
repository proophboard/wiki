If you encounter performance problems on large boards or during video calls, you can turn on the Lite Mode. This will disable zoom effects like hiding/showing elements.

Effects turned off means your browser has less expensive tasks to do. This saves CPU and therefore also battery time.
{: .alert .alert-success}

Disadvantage of course is, that you have to show or hide details by hand. `Double click` on a frame to show its details. Keep `Ctrl/Cmd pressed and double click` again, to hide details.
The show/hide details action is also available in the context menu of a frame (if lite mode is active). Right-click on a frame and select `Lite Mode -> show/hide details`. 
{: .alert .alert-warning}

_Please Note: With Lite Mode turned on, a double click has two meanings. If details of a frame are hidden, they are shown like described above. If details are already visible, the label editor is activated according to the normal double click behavior._

Switching between Normal and Lite Mode can be done in the workspace top menu. It's the battery icon next to your avatar. The following table compares both modes:

|   |  Mode  | Show/Hide Details on Zoom | Font Scaling | Performance |
|---|:------:|:-------------------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/normal_mode.png" />  | Normal |             ✅             |       ✅      |      ❌      |
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/lite_mode.png" />  |  Lite  |             ❌             |       ❌      |      ✅      |

_The chosen mode is persisted across sessions. If you prefer to always work in Lite Mode, you can set it once._
