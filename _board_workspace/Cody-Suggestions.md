[Cody]({{site.baseUrl}}/cody/introduction.html) is deeply integrated on prooph board. It does not only translate designs into working code, but also helps you with the design itself.

</div>


When [Event Modeling Mode]({{site.baseUrl}}/board_workspace/Event-Modeling-Mode.html) is enabled, Cody appears within a [Slice]({{site.baseUrl}}/board_workspace/Frames.html#event-modeling-slice) to
suggest cards. If Event Modeling is turned off, Cody switches the suggestion style to [Continuous Event Storming]({{site.baseUrl}}/continuous_event_storming/event-map-design.html).
The latter was the default format on prooph board, before we fully integrated Event Modeling. If you prefer this style, Cody will continue to help you with it.

## Turn Off

You can disable Cody Suggestions in the board settings.
