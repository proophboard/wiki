## Sketch fast, complete later

Don't try to make the Event Map look perfectly arranged in a collaboration session. Design/sketch fast and assign a responsible person to clean up or add missing details after the session.
This ensures a fast flow and does not kill creativity during collaboration.

## Managing Hot Spots

When practicing Continuous Event Storming on prooph board you'll soon need to find a good way to manage Hot Spots.

We love Hot Spots. They are the best tool in a collaboration session to keep focus. It's easy to zoom into process details or spontaneously discuss ideas with Event Storming. But at some point you'll need to stop to not lose focus on the main session topic. Hot Spots are made for such situations:

- Discovered a new bottleneck -> write it on a [Hot Spot]({{site.baseurl}}/event_storming/basic-concepts.html#hot-spot){: target="_blank"}
- Found a promising new idea -> write it on a [Hot Spot](({{site.baseurl}}/event_storming/basic-concepts.html#hot-spot)){: target="_blank"}
- Need to address a bug in the system -> write it on a [Hot Spot]({{site.baseurl}}/event_storming/basic-concepts.html#hot-spot){: target="_blank"}

A couple of sessions later your prooph board will be full of Hot Spots. That's normal. It always happens. People get the idea of Hot Spots really quick.

But a Hot Spot is only as good as the action item derived from it! So how to distinguish between urgent Hot Spots that need to be resolved as soon as possible and for example ideas for later?

To categorize Hot Spots you can use [Card Tags]({{site.baseurl}}/board_workspace/Cards.html#tagging). We assign the tag **#later** to all Hot Spots containing ideas. Tagging Hot Spots allows you to filter them in the tree view. You can search for tags in combination with card types and also use a "NOT" operator to look up all Hot Spots that don't have a specific tag assigned.
