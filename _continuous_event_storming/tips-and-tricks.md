## Sketch fast, complete later

Don't try to make the Event Map look perfectly arranged in a collaboration session. Design/sketch fast and assign a responsible person to clean up or add missing details after the session.
This ensures a fast flow and does not kill creativity during collaboration. 

## Make use of Tags and Metadata

The Event Map should give all team members a good overview of the system, but not everybody is interested in all information. [Card Metadata]({{site.baseUrl}}/board_workspace/Metadata.html)
can be used to separate technical information like the schema of a command or event from more general information like its name and position in the business flow.
Try to find a balance between always visible and secondary information. [Card Tags]({{site.baseUrl}}/board_workspace/Cards.html#tagging) on the other hand can highlight and group specific information.
